*Classification and Prediction*  

## What is classification? What is prediction?  

  
### 1. Classification  
:  


**Model Construction**  

**Model Usage**  

**Accuracy Evaluation**  

cf. Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning  
- Supervised Learning   
- Unsupervised Learning  

### 2. Prediction
:  


## Issues regarding classification and prediction  


### 1. Issues : Data Preparation  

### 2. Issues : Evaluating Classification Methods  

## Classification by decision tree induction  


### 1. Algorithm  

### 2. Test Attribute Selection - Attribute Selection Measure  
- Information Gain  
- Gain Ratio  
- Gini Index  

### 3. Overfitting  

- Overfitting  
: 
problem = 

- Tree pruning  
: to avoid overfitting  
- Prepruning  
- Postpruning  

### 4. Why decision tree in data mining  


### 5. Rule extraction from a Decision Tree  


## Bayesian classification
